    	<p>VEB Orange opened back in 2005 by Mario Schubert in Prenzlauer Berg, Berlin. A man who is passionate and fascinated about the 60’s and 70’s - especially the DDR era. Mario can give you the whole culture and story behind almost every thing in the shop.
        <br>
We will take you on a journey back in time to the old DDR. You can quickly get to spend a long time studying and turn every thing to see what other interesting thing lying underneath. 
    <br>
So if you are looking for some new modern retro-style for your home or just a nice unique experience, then come by VEB Orange and have a look. Here is certainly not boring and lots of colors to enliven your day.</p>
